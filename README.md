# countdown_project
It's a beginner project, where I created a countdown 'website' using html, javascript and css. It's not perfect, but it'll do it for me.

If you download them all into one file, and you open the html file, you'll see 3 types of inputs.

1st one: 
 - You can type in the information into the input field in the format the placeholder asks for.
 - One way to enter the data is by pressing enter after every input, but it takes a lot of time.
 - The other way is that you press the Start button after filling in the inputs. It'll automatically collect all information from the input fields.

  if you want to restart the whole, you need to press the reset button. It'll stop the countdown and reset the chosen date.
  
2nd one:
 - you can use the default date and time inputs, but it's not quite up-to-date (and as I see it, sh*tty.
 - Once you hit the count button, it'll start the countdown
 - If you want to set the inputs to default, start the countdown or doubleclick on the input field and it'll delete that one.
 - you can restart by using the reset button above


fun feature for the first two options: you'll get a picture and a text after the countdown goes off

3rd one:
- It has autofill options, that can be found at the beginning of the javascript file, but I'm working on taking in data from a google form or an object, but haven't yet found the perfect solution for it.
- You select the appropriate event, press autofill button, and it'll start counting to that date.
- extra feature is that you can set a picture and a text that will be displayed after the countdown goes off. The name of the images are "i_img.png" where i is the number of the option in order and the used texts are in an array at the beginning of the js file.

 Few things you need to add to the codes after you downloaded it:
- the pictures you want to display after the autofill goes down (watch out! their names must be "i_img.png" where i = place of the autofill in order from 0)
        - they should be in the same folder as the other codes.
- the text's you would like to display after the autofill goes down (again, watch out for the order of the texts)
        - you can add them at the begginning of the javascript file in the texts[] array
- the dates for the autofill
        - same as the previous one, at the beginnning of the js file, but in the dates[] array
- the options in the html code, but look out, you mustn't change the value of the option, but the innerHTML of it.


Enjoy it!
